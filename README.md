# Hearthstone-Lite

## Brief about the project
This project is a simpler copy of the Hearthstone game built using java OOP and the MVC model.

The game is a 2-player turn-based strategy card game , each player has a deck of cards to play with along with a selected hero with a unique power.
Players use their limited mana crystals to play abilities, cast spells, or summon minions to attack the opponent, with the goal of destroying the opponent's hero.

These are the 4 types of available heroes and their powers:
- Mage: Inflict one damage point to a specific target (a hero or a minion).
- Hunter: Inflict two damage points to the opponent hero.
- Priest: Restore two health points to a specific target (a hero or a minion).
- Warlock: Draw an extra card and inflict two damage points to the hero.
- Paladin: Create a new minion with the following attributes and add it to the field:
   - Its currentHP, maxHp and attack value (all with a value of 1).
   - Its name is ”Silver Hand Recruit”.
   - It is a non-taunt, non-divine and non-charge minion.
   - It costs 1 mana crystal.
